# SAP Business One Table Reference

This project provides an open-source resource that maps operational entities to their technical attributes in SAP Business One. 

It contains a JSON representation of the core tables, their descriptions, primary keys, and object types used in SAP Business One. 

This serves as an invaluable reference for developers, data analysts, and anyone else working with SAP Business One data who needs to understand its underlying structure and organization. 

By providing this information as a JSON array, the project allows for easy data manipulation and usage in various programming languages, as well as dynamic consumption through API calls directly to the GitHub API.

Collaboration is the key to enhancing this resource. We welcome contributions from the community. If you have new information or enhancements, feel free to raise a Pull Request.

In addition to using the data provided in this project, software applications and services can consume this information dynamically straight from GitHub, making this a highly flexible resource for projects that interact with SAP Business One.
